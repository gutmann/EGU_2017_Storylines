    \begin{block}{1. Introduction}

     \begin{itemize}
      \justifying

      \item Future climate projections are inherently uncertain, and quantifying and managing this uncertainty is one of the key tasks in any climate application.
      \item Previous research assessing climate change impacts on hydrologic systems shows a need to understand the sources of this uncertainty so that future work can reduce uncertainty, and so that the most realistic assessment of uncertainty can be presented.
      \item This uncertainty stems from chaotic variability in the climate system \citep{Deser_2014} and from the uncertain nature of the methods we use \citep{Gutmann_2012,Mendoza_2016,Mizukami_2016,Clark_2016} (either from lack of understanding of the system or intentional simplifications in our models.)
      \item We focus on quantifying the uncertainty that comes from methodological choices related to emissions scenarios, climate models, downscaling methods, and hydrology models and parameters (see Figure \ref{fig:storylines}).

    \begin{block}{2. Hydrologic Storylines}

     \begin{itemize}
      \justifying

      \item We aim to develop a set of representative hydrologic projections or ``storylines'' while specifically addressing the leading contributors of uncertainty.
      \item The first step is to characterize the uncertainties in the ``full'' ensemble in order to understand where and how much each component of the model chain contributes to the full ensemble's uncertainty.
      \item The second phase of the project will focus on reducing uncertainties by refining methodologies and eliminating unlikely ensemble members.
      \item Finally, distinct hydrologic storylines will be developed using data-driven and bottom-upsampling methods to represent the range of likely outcomes with a minimum number of ensemble members.

     \end{itemize}

     \begin{itemize}
      \justifying

      \item A wide array of downscaling and bias correction methodologies have been proposed.
      \item Not all downscaling methods are created equal. Some methods create artifacts even in historical climate \citep{Gutmann_2014}, with implications for hydrologic modeling \citep{Mizukami_2016}.
      \item We are developing the Generalized Analog Regression Downscaling (GARD) tool to provide a simple statistical downscaling method capable of implementing a variety of statistical transformations from various inputs (e.g. precipitation, humidity, wind, PCA, etc.) to various outputs (e.g. precipitation, temperature, etc.). See http://gard.readthedocs.io/.
      \item We have developed a quasi-dynamical downscaling tool ICAR, the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research model \citep{Gutmann_2016}.
      \item Simple / existing downscaling methods (e.g. BCSD) are being compared to progressively more complex methods like GARD, ICAR, and WRF to better understand how methodological complexity is related to fidelity and sensitivity.

    \begin{block}{4. Hydrologic Modeling}

        \begin{itemize}
         \justifying
         \item Typical hydrologic climate impacts studies do not explore how hydrologic model structure or model parameters influence the inferences derived from the modeling activity.
         \item We will use the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) model \citep{Clark_2015} to generate large a series of different modeling approaches using the same structural core (see Figure \ref{fig:summa}). Using SUMMA allows for the controlled and systematic analysis of modeling options and complexities.
         \item Model parameters will be derived using the Multi-scale Parameter Regionalization (MPR) method of \citet{Samaniego_2010}. Using MPR allows for the generation of ensembles of parameters, derived from calibrations performed using an array of objective functions.

     \begin{itemize}
      \justifying
      \item We are developing a large ensemble of hydrologic projections over the CONUS domain.
      \item Our controlled evaluation of both the climate forcing and hydrologic modeling will allow for increased understanding of uncertainty derived from each component of the climate impacts modeling chain.

     \begin{shaded}

      \begin{itemize}         \vspace{1cm}
       \justifying
       \item Hydrologic climate projections have uncertainty from the climate forcing (emissions scenarios, climate models, initial conditions) and from the hydrologic modeling application (model structure and parameters). We are systematically characterizing these uncertainties. \vspace{1cm}
       \item We are developing new climate downscaling tools (e.g. GARD, ICAR) to fill in the complexity continuum. These tools will facilitate the generation of large ensembles of climate forcings and new analysis approaches that target the relationship between complexity, fidelity, and sensitivity. \vspace{1cm}
       \item New data-driven and bottom-up sampling methods are being developed to enable the selection of smaller sets of representative hydrologic projections (storylines) while addressing the leading contributors of uncertainty. \vspace{1cm}
